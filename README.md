# odin-signUpForm
The Odin Project | Intermediate HTML &amp; CSS | Project: Sign-up Form

Tips:

1. The inputs, by default have a very light border (#E5E7EB), but weâ€™ve included 2 variations. For starters, the password inputs should be given an error class.
2. Checking that the password fields match each other requires javascript. Try to implement this if you feel confident, otherwise just validate each field separately.
